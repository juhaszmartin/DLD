##  Overview

This project is a reproduction and update of the seminal paper **"Digital Language Death"** by András Kornai (2013). 

> **Original Paper:** > Kornai A. (2013) *Digital Language Death*. PLoS ONE 8(10): e77056.

### The Goal
The original study argued that less than **5%** of the world's 7,000 languages would ascend to the digital realm, with the rest facing "digital death." This repository applies Kornai's original methodology to **newer data (2020-2025)** to see if the "digital divide" has widened or narrowed over the last decade.
